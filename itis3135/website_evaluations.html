            <h3><a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/">IBM</a></h3>
            <p>This is IBM's home webpage for all its customers. It allows access to their products, solutions, consulting and customer support.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - Good, mostly black text with white background with a royal blue elements added through the site.</li>
                <li>Repitition - Great, buttons and interactive aspects of the site stay consistant without overloading the front page</li>
                <li>Alignment - Great, table of contents on left hand side allows for easy navigation</li>
                <li>Proximity - Great - elements are well spaced out and allows user to easily see what they are looking at</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">CraigsList</a></h3>
            <p>This is the homepage for craigslist which acts as a table of contents for almost anything you would need in your local area</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - Bad, home page consist of white background with almost all of the text being hyperlink blue</li>
                <li>Repitition - Bad, site has a lot of text that is easy for quick navigation but looks terrible</li>
                <li>Alignment - Okay, page doesn't utalize all of the screen so you change the size of the tab everything just stays perfectly still</li>
                <li>Proximity - Bad, all of the text is a small font size and lowercase so everything is forced to be real close to each other and makes it hard to read without zooming in</li>
            </ul>
