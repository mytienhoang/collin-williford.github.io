                <p>The Nike Waffle 5 spikes are a spike/flat mix that I got in anticipation to use for both cross country and track season. I only ended up using them for one cross country season as I was a little dissapointed in their performance. The upper is a snug fit which comes from not having a tounge but rather its one whole piece which makes puttin on the shoe rather difficult. The midsole and outsole is where I was dissapointed in the shoe as the outsole feels like plastic and doesn't get good grid on both cross country gravel courses or rubber trackes. I ended up retiring the shoe rather quickly as I moved onto a Nike Dragonflys for the track season.</p>

                <p>The Nike Pegasus 37 Trail was quite the supprise for me as I wasn't expecting it to be as comfy espically when compared to the normal Nike Pegasus 37's. I got this shoe and orginally had no intentions of running in it but after feeling how comfy it was I felt like it deserved to be run on cross country courses. I wanted to give the shoe a higher score but the outsoles performance in wet conditions was rather dissapointing as it didn't provide the grip I would have expected from a trail shoe.</p>
