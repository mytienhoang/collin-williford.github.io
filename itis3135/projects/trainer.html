                <p>The Nike Invincible 2 is currently my go to daily training shoe as I am now on my second pair which I have only put 50 miles on so far. Nike has made the midsole entirely out of their signature ZoomX foam which creates a very maximum cushion shoe and I find to be very forgiving for easy and recovery days. I tend to stay above 7:30 mile pace on this shoe as its one major downside is its weight at 11.2 oz for a men's size 10. But this isn't really a downfall as I really appriciate the high midsole as I primarily run on asphalt which is where this shoe really shines.</p>

                <p>The Saucony Endorphin Speed 3 was a major disapointment for me espically as I previously trained in the speed 2 and loved it. I'll start off with the upper as their isn't too much of a difference from the speed 2 and I have no complaints about but the shoe laces ruined the fitment for me. They are new circular laces that I couldn't get tight and ended up brusing the top of my foot as I had to way overtighten them to get my foot lockeddown. The midsole brings more issues for me as Saucony reportily made minor tweeks for the speed 3 but I found it to be much harder espically in the forefoot but felt softer in the heel. I tend to be a midfoot and forefoot runner but running in this shoe was to uncomfortable for me and I started to favor landing heavily on my heel. After only 35 miles I noticed that happening so stopped wearing the shoes and don't have any intentions on running in them any more. </p>

                <p>The Nike Pegasus 38 I picked up after enjoying my Pegasus 37's as a daily trainer and was initally a little concerned about the changes made to the 38 but wanted to give them a chance. I only made it about 80 miles on this shoe before they felt completely dead causing me shin pains so I just went ahead and retired them. Nike also made some questionable choices to the upper on the 38's that I really don't understand. The entire mesh is noticible thicker from the 37's which traps a lot more heat inside the shoe and the laces are also a little bit thicker which I found to untie a lot at seemingly random times. Nike also says the 38's have an airpod in the forefod which I couldn't feel at all throught the lifespan of the shoe which made the shoe feel very bland.</p>
