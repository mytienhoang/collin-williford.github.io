                <p>The Hoka Rocket X 2 are a recently released long distance race day shoe from HOKA which greatly improves of the past generation of their Rocket lineup. Its a ground up redesign with a new midsole and upper that I liked a lot on my initial runs in this shoe. I am not going to give the shoe a score yet as I have only put 16 miles on this shoe, 6 on the treadmill and another 10 on a long run with both gravel and asphalt surfaces. The first and most notable change about this shoe for me was the entirely new PEBA midsole that HOKA used which is very soft and in combination with the full length carbon plate was very comfortable at longer distances. The shoe felt very light and the forefoot rocker made it a lot easier for a more controlled effort over the longer distances. Overall I am really excited to put some more miles on this shoe as I got it primarily for long runs which I see being its strongest capability. </p>

                <p>Score: 9.5/10</p>
                <p>The Nike Next% Vaporfly 2 has been a staple race day shoe that I use a lot in my workouts and has been a staple in the long distance racing community for the past couple of years. For me the shoe seems to be the best carbon plated road shoe as the combination of Nikes ZoomX foam with the full length carbon fiber plate creates a snappy response from the shoe and makes high intensity efforts feel like a breeze. The only problem that I have with this shoe while minor is the shoelaces, they are not a typical lace but rather has grooves on either side which I believe was to save weight but it makes getting a proper lockdown a challenge at times. I often find my self starting workouts and having to retie them at least once to get a better fit. Overall I can see myself in the future running a half marathon with this shoe as its high score and all the hype around it is absolutely deserved. </p>
