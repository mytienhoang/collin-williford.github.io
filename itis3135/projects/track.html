                <p>The Nike Dragonfly I recently purchased going into the this outdoor track season as I knew they where the popular choice among middle and long distance track athleats. I mostly use them for track workouts and have also used thme in a couple 1600m track races and have been very happy with their performance. I got the feeling they where very versatile during workouts as I have used them while doing 200m,300m,400m repeats, fartleks and threshold sesions which is where they shine for me. They have the short distance speed in them and their light weight makes a comfortable fit at fast speeds. The only downside I have noticed in the dragonfly is the laces which are the same ones used in the vaporfly next%, which are a divited lace and is difficult to get a comfortable lockdown at times.</p>

                <p>The Adidas Adizero Avanti TYO was a spike that I was really interested to try out as I saw the increased stack height from its rival the Nike Dragonfly could offer a more comfortable ride but I was mistaken. This shoe has several problems from my testing and I'll start off with the fitment. I am a mens size 10.5 and I ordered the shoe in a 10.5 thinking I wan't a little more space for the longer distance track workouts which this shoe is advertised for. When I first tried on the show I instantly realized I made a mistake as I can put two thumbs in front of my big toe and have heard from others they have the same problem which is very unexpeced for a track spike. The most annoying about this shoe for me was the lack of spike plate in the forefoot. After only running about 600 meters on the track I could feel the individual spikes through the midsole which left me with hotspots on the bottom of my foot which quickly turned into blisters. I tried to give the shoe a couple of chances but it got to the point where I couldn't wear the shoe without it being uncomfortable and had to set the shoes aside. Overall the midsole and upper felt great on the shoe beside from the glaring issue perviously mentioned which really let my hopes down for this shoe.</p>

                <p>The Nike Steakfly was a shoe that I was really interested in trying out and got my hands on a pair recently but my initial runs in it haven't been that great. I got this shoe as an alternative to spikes when doing track workouts that I just didn't want to wear on my calves as much. The low stack height and ZoomX foam is great for doing faster workouts which is exactly what I want it for but the only drawback that I have found is the upper being to flexable. I started to notice my foot moving a little around the forefoot and the think the combination of having thin laces with a breathable thin uppper is to blame for this. I don't want to give up on this shoe yet as it initally felt great on the track so I wan't to try some different laces and sock combinations and see how they feel.</p>
