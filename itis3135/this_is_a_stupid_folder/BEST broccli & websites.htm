        <p class="song">White shirt now red, my bloody nose
            <ul class="center">
            <li>Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes</li>
            <li>Creepin' around like no one knows</li>
            <li>Think you're so criminal</li>
            <li>Bruises on both my knees for you</li>
            </ul>Don't say thank you or please
            I do what I want when I'm wanting to
            My soul? So cynical
            So you're a tough guy
            Like it really rough guy
            Just can't get enough guy
            Chest always so puffed guy
            I'm that bad type
            Make your mama sad type
            Make your girlfriend mad tight
            Might seduce your dad type
            <p class="center">I'm the bad guy, duh
            I'm the bad guy
            I like it when you take control
            Even if you know that you don't
            Own me, I'll let you play the role
            I'll be your animal
            My mommy likes to sing along with me
            But she won't sing this song
            </p>If she reads all the lyrics
            She'll pity the men I know
            So you're a tough guy
            Like it really rough guy
            Just can't get enough guy
            Chest always so puffed guy
            I'm that bad type
            Make your mama sad type
            Make your girlfriend mad tight
            Might seduce your dad type
            I'm the bad guy, duh
            I'm the bad guy, duh
            I'm only good at being bad, bad
            I like when you get mad
            I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
            You said she's scared of me?
            I mean, I don't see what she sees
            But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
            I'm a bad guy
            I'm, I'm a bad guy
            Bad guy, bad guy
            I'm a bad</p>
